# IBM_spread_w_donation_game
A 2D individual-based model for range expansion with frequency dependent selection. Created for UBC MATH 564, 2020W1 

50 simulations for each r value:
## simulation sets used:
r=0.5  with b=1, c=0.5
r=0.25 with b=2, c=0.5
r=0.1  with b=5, c=0.5
r=0.05 with b=10, c=0.5

no selection, b=0 c=0
